Exam 3 Study Guide
==================

## Format

Exam 3 will take place in person on Monday, Apr 17 from 3-4:40pm. It will be 8-12 questions in length. You may be asked to define terminology, trace code, explain code, and write code. 

The exam will be *on paper*. Your solutions must be handwritten; however, you will be permitted to use any resources you wish (including the internet and/or a Python interpreter) to test your code or look up syntax. You are not permitted to look up entire solutions to problems (or ask ChatGPT to give you the solution). I expect you to use resources as you would for your homework problems. If I suspect that any part of your solution has been copied in whole or in part from another source I reserve the right to require an additional, oral code review of your solutions. Failure to explain your solution may result in a 0 on the exam and/or a report to the academic integrity committee.

The exam will primarily focus on topics covered since Exam 2; however, there may be questions related to topics discussed in the first part of the semester. For example, it is likely there will be a recursion question on the exam!


## Topics

The exam may cover any topics we have discussed this semester. It is recommended that you review the Exam 1 and Exam 2 study guides as well.

The topics *emphasized* on Exam 3 will include the following:

* Stacks
  - Describe the result of applying one or more push/pop operations
  - Identify and fix bugs in a Stack implementation
  - Add additional operations to a Stack implementation
  - Use a Stack to solve a problem (e.g., determining whether parens are matching)
* Queues
  - Describe the result of applying one or more enqueue/dequeue operations
  - Identify and fix bugs in a Queue implementation that uses a circular buffer
* Efficiency
  - Determine the runtime bounds of an algorithm or code snippet (e.g., understand running time of operations on lists versus dictionaries)
  - Design a data structure to ensure a particular runtime bound for a given operation 
* Linear search
  - Find an item in a list
* Binary search
  - Identify and fix bugs in a binary search implementation
  - Trace the execution of a binary search implementation
* Sorting
  - Trace the execution of a sorting algorithm -- insertion, selection, or bubble sort
