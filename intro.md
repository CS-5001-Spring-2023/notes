### What is an algorithm?

Exercise: Consider the Wordle game. How would you determine whether a solution was correct? How would you determine which letters of an incorrect solution should be green? How would you determine which letters of an incorrect solution should be orange?

### Your first Python program!
	
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Exercise: How about printing "Hello, Giovanni" or "Hello, Hiromi" or "Hello, {name}"? What happens in the code below?

```python
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, Giovanni")

print("Hello, Hiromi")

name = input("What is your name? ")

print("Hello, name") 

print(f"Hello, {name}")

print("Hello, %s" % name)

print("Hello, " + name)

greeting = "Hello"

print(greeting + name)

print(f"{greeting}, {name}")
```

### Arithmetic operators: + - * / % ** //

Exercise 1: Convert centimeters to feet. One foot is 30.48 cm.

Exercise 2: Convert seconds to minutes.

Exercise 3: In this example we are going to calculate the salary of a camera salesman. His basic salary is 1 500, for every camera he will sell he will get 200 and the commission on the monthâ€™s sale is 2 %. The input will be number of cameras sold and total price of the cameras.
